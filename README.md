***Selected  Domain***:
WEB DEVELOPMENT

****Problem Statement****:
“Campus Bridge – Integrated Academic LMS + Coding 
Skill Development Platform” 
Objective: 
Build a unified web application that functions as an end-to-end academic and 
coding skill development environment for university students. The platform 
should integrate: 
 LMS capabilities to manage academic courses, attendance, assessments, 
and faculty interaction. (ex: My Camu) 
 Coding training modules with an online compiler, structured learning 
paths, problem-solving tracks, and performance analytics just like 
Talentio. 
 AI Assistant: 
1. Real-time code hints or logic debugging assistant using 
Gemini/GPT. 
2. Live Group Code Rooms: Students can collaboratively work 
on coding problems (pair programming). 
3. Job Match Recommender: Matches student portfolios with 
mock job descriptions based on skillsets. 
4. Smart Code Review Bot: AI-based feedback for code quality, 
naming conventions, and best practices. 
Core Functional Modules: 
 Student Interface: 
 Access academic courses, lecture materials, assignments, and attendance 
(LMS module) 
 Enroll in coding tracks (e.g., DSA, Web Dev, Python, Java) 
 Practice coding questions inside a built-in code editor/compiler (support 
multiple languages like C, C++, Python, Java)

****Description****:

Campus Bridge is a unified web-based platform designed to streamline academic learning and coding skill development for university students. The objective is to bridge the gap between theoretical education and industry-ready coding proficiency through an integrated Learning Management System (LMS) and interactive coding ecosystem.

On the academic side, Campus Bridge offers robust LMS features such as course management, lecture scheduling, attendance tracking, assignment submissions, and faculty-student interaction—similar to platforms like MyCamu. Simultaneously, it empowers students to upskill in coding through structured learning paths (e.g., DSA, Web Development, Python, Java), an in-browser compiler supporting multiple languages, and real-time performance analytics, much like Talentio.

To enhance the user experience, the platform integrates advanced AI capabilities. These include an AI assistant for code suggestions and debugging, live group code rooms for collaborative programming, a smart code review bot for evaluating coding best practices, and a job match recommender that aligns student profiles with industry job descriptions.

The system supports three primary user roles: students, faculty/trainers, and administrators. Students can manage both their academic and coding journeys from a single dashboard. Faculty can publish academic content, create coding assignments, and track progress. Admins can monitor university-wide analytics, manage placements, and generate performance reports.

Campus Bridge aims to revolutionize campus learning by combining academic rigor with hands-on coding practice and intelligent career readiness tools—all within a single, accessible platform.

##Project Explanation##:

Campus Bridge is an integrated web application built to provide university students with a comprehensive platform for both academic learning and coding skill development. The platform is structured into three primary modules: LMS (Learning Management System), Coding Skill Development, and AI-Assisted Tools, each designed to address a specific need in the academic ecosystem.

1. LMS Module
This module allows students to access academic course content, lecture videos, PDFs, assignments, and attendance records. Faculty can upload and manage academic material, schedule quizzes, and monitor individual or class-wide academic performance. This ensures seamless communication and resource sharing between students and faculty.


2. Coding Skill Development Module
Inspired by platforms like Talentio and LeetCode, this module enables students to enroll in structured coding tracks such as DSA, Web Development, Python, or Java. Each track includes learning content, problem sets, and real-time coding challenges. An in-browser compiler supports multiple languages (C, C++, Python, Java), allowing students to practice and test their code directly within the platform.


3. AI Assistant Tools
To enhance user engagement and improve outcomes, several AI-powered features are integrated:

Code Hint & Debug Assistant: Offers real-time coding suggestions using GPT/Gemini models.

Live Group Code Rooms: Facilitates pair programming and group problem-solving sessions.

Smart Code Review Bot: Automatically analyzes submitted code for quality, naming conventions, and performance.

Job Match Recommender: Uses AI to match student profiles with mock job roles based on their skills, badges, and coding activity.



4. Role-Based Interfaces

Student Panel: Centralized dashboard for courses, assignments, coding practice, and skill tracking.

Faculty/Trainer Panel: Tools to manage content, assignments, and student analytics.

Admin/Placement Panel: University-level dashboard to monitor academic and coding metrics, organize mock interviews/tests, and export reports.




Campus Bridge thus provides a one-stop solution for academic success, technical growth, and career readiness.
