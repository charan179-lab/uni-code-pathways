# Welcome to our Campus bridge project

## Project info

**URL**: https://uni-code-pathways.vercel.app/

***Selected  Domain***:
WEB DEVELOPMENT

****Problem Statement****:
“Campus Bridge – Integrated Academic LMS + Coding 
Skill Development Platform” 
Objective: 
Build a unified web application that functions as an end-to-end academic and 
coding skill development environment for university students. The platform 
should integrate: 
 LMS capabilities to manage academic courses, attendance, assessments, 
and faculty interaction. (ex: My Camu) 
 Coding training modules with an online compiler, structured learning 
paths, problem-solving tracks, and performance analytics just like 
Talentio. 
 AI Assistant: 
1. Real-time code hints or logic debugging assistant using 
Gemini/GPT. 
2. Live Group Code Rooms: Students can collaboratively work 
on coding problems (pair programming). 
3. Job Match Recommender: Matches student portfolios with 
mock job descriptions based on skillsets. 
4. Smart Code Review Bot: AI-based feedback for code quality, 
naming conventions, and best practices. 
Core Functional Modules: 
 Student Interface: 
 Access academic courses, lecture materials, assignments, and attendance 
(LMS module) 
 Enroll in coding tracks (e.g., DSA, Web Dev, Python, Java) 
 Practice coding questions inside a built-in code editor/compiler (support 
multiple languages like C, C++, Python, Java)
